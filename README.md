# employee-scheduling
The employee scheduling website I built for RIT Dining Commons using Django.

This is the bulk of the code for the employee scheduling website I built in three months with Django.
It is described [here on Starman Innovations](http://www.starmaninnovations.com/portfolio/websites/diningcommons) and
can be seen here: http://dcdemo.starmaninnovations.com/

Of course, I deliberately left out some files, such as the settings.py file and database file, for security reasons.
Nonetheless, what's left is all my work anyway, so it should suffice to demonstrate that I know Django pretty well.

My personal website was also built with Django and you can see the code over at my GitHub repository:
