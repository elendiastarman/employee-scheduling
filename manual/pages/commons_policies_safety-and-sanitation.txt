To avoid injury in a kitchen environment use caution and common sense.  **Always assume that everything is hot, everything is sharp, and that the floor is slippery.** Err on the side of caution to stay safe.

- **Chemical Safety:** The most common chemicals used in The Commons are sanitizer and glass cleaner. With all chemicals avoid contact with the eyes and skin and avoid inhalation and ingestion. Do not mix different chemicals.  If you have any questions about a chemical or have not been shown how to use it safely, do not use it. Ask a supervisor or manager for assistance if you have any questions. Material Safety Data Sheets with information regarding all of the chemicals used in The Commons are available in the office upon request.
- **Equipment Safety:** For every job in The Commons you will be trained to use any necessary equipment. If you have not been trained in how to use a piece of equipment DO NOT use it. Ask a supervisor or manager for assistance if you have any questions. This helps to both prevent injuries and to prevent damage to equipment.
- **Knife Safety:** If you are placed in a job that requires the use of a knife you are required to wear a cut-resistant glove. Though they do help to reduce injuries, the gloves are cut-resistant, not cut proof. If you are reckless or careless you can still injure yourself even while wearing a cut resistant glove. Always be careful while using a knife or any other potentially dangerous utensil. The use of a cut-resistant glove when using a knife is mandatory even if you are only using the knife briefly or one time, anyone neglecting to comply will have their employment terminated immediately.
- **Cooler and Freezer Safety:** Use care when entering and leaving the coolers and freezer and be aware that the floor may be slippery or icy. If you are ever in a cooler or freezer and the door closes behind you, do not panic. The doors do not automatically lock. If you are unable to exit a freezer or cooler there is a large, round, yellow panic button to the right of each door. Pressing that button will set off an alarm and help will come.
- **Food Safety:** Always adhere to sanitation policies and follow instructions regarding food safety. If you have any questions regarding food safety please ask a supervisor or manager immediately.
