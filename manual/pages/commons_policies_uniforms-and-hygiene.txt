<Section: Uniforms>

Do not punch in until you have stowed any personal belongings in the locker rooms downstairs and you are fully dressed in your Commons or College Grind uniform. Your uniform will consist of the following things; all of them are required:
- **Head Covering:** You must wear an acceptable head covering at all times. You may wear either a Commons/College Grind baseball cap or visor. If you do not have one of these you will be given a hairnet. Baseball caps and visors will be worn with the brim forward. No knit caps unless you are a delivery driver working during inclement weather. If you have any questions regarding whether or not your headwear is appropriate, ask a supervisor or manager.
- **T-Shirt:** You must wear a Commons T-shirt, Commons polo, or College Grind polo at all times. You will be issued one Commons T-shirt or College Grind polo. Maintaining this shirt is your responsibility, keep it clean. If you work more than three shifts per week you may be issued another shirt upon request. If you lose or damage your shirt you may be charged for it.
- **Long Pants:** You must wear long pants that cover your entire leg all the way to the ankle. Pants must be worn at the waist, bring a belt if necessary. No shorts, skirts, dresses, capris, kilts, etc. will be permitted. No sweatpants, track pants, gym pants, break-away pants, leggings, jeggings, or tights will be allowed. This policy helps to protect you from splashes of hot water or oil.
- **Shoes:** You must wear closed toed, rubber soled shoes. No high heels, canvas shoes, sandals, or slippers will be allowed. Slip/oil resistant shoes are recommended. Some jobs may require that you wear slip resistant overshoes, these are available to all employees upon request.
- **Name tag:** You must wear YOUR name tag at all times. At the end of your shift your name tag should be left in The Commons. You may be charged for lost name tags.

If you arrive without proper work attire you will be sent home and your absence counted as unexcused!

Food service workers should practice good personal hygiene.
- Shower and wash daily, especially on days that you work, before your shift.
- Show up clean and fresh smelling.
