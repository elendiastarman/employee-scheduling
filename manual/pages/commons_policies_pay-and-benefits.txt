- Hot food purchased during the closing shift is to be placed in the hotbox located in the pizza serving area, cold food is to be placed in the table cooler in the pizza server area. Do not store your food in any other area. You may collect your food from that area at the end of your shift. You may be asked to show any food that you are taking out to the supervisor to prevent theft.
- You may not make your own food. Go through the line and order your food just like any regular customer.
