No wearing headphones, they must be put away, out of sight.

This ensures that your station has someone there to operate it, that you are leaving on time, that you are completing all of your tasks, and that you are not leaving things dirty or understocked for the next shift. On closing shifts you may be able to finish all of your tasks early, management can then direct you to other stations that may require assistance so that everyone can work together and assist one another.
