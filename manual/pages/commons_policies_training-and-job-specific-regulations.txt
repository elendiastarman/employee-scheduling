<Title: Training and Job-Specific Regulation>

<Section: Training>

- **First Shift:** Employees will be trained on the job during their first shifts at The Commons. Any questions should be directed to a supervisor or student manager. Do not attempt to do a job for which you have not been properly trained. 

- **Online Training:** There is certain basic information that anyone working around food should be familiar with for food safety reasons.  For this reason all employees are required to complete the [Dining Services online training](http://www.rit.edu/fa/diningservices/content/dining-services-training) within their first two weeks of being hired and once every year thereafter. Employees will be asked to log in using their RIT computer account during their online training sessions and will later be compensated for their time. You get paid for doing the online training! Failure to complete this mandatory training in a timely fashion will result in immediate termination. 

<Section: Special Positions>

<Subsection: Delivery Drivers>

- **Requirements:** In order to sign up for a delivery shift you must have your own vehicle. **DO NOT sign up for a delivery shift if you do not have your own car, valid insurance, and a valid driver's license.** This includes delivery sub shifts.
- **Clothing and Phone Use:** Delivery drivers may wear winter knit caps during inclement weather instead of the usual baseball cap or hairnet. Delivery drivers may use their cell phones during their shift for **work related calling/texting only.**
- **Fuel Compensation:** In order to offset the cost of fuel for delivery drivers, delivery drivers will be paid an extra dollar per delivery order. A one dollar delivery surcharge is automatically added on to the cost of each delivery order. To collect this extra dollar per order, delivery drivers must save their delivery address slips and submit them to a supervisor promptly at the end of each shift. Slips should be signed with the delivery driver’s name and neatly stapled together. Delivery drivers who do not turn in all of their delivery slips promptly at the end of their shift will not be compensated for those deliveries.

<Subsection: Cashiers>

- **Mandatory Training:** All cashiers must be trained by a full-time staff person or a student manager before working as a cashier, this includes cashier sub shifts. No one should under any circumstances attempt to operate a cash register unless they are scheduled as a cashier or have been directed to do so by a supervisor or manager.
- **Accountability:** Register sign in cards are not to be shared or used on any register aside from the one for which they are intended. The register sign in card that one cashier is using should never be used by another person as doing so could result in a discrepancy in the register’s records. As a cashier **you** are responsible for the cash that is in the register, the student meal receipts, and the accurate ringing up of all items. Do not let anyone else use your register or sign in card. If the total amount of cash in the cash register or the student meal receipts are off, or items are being rung up incorrectly the cashier will be held responsible and may be removed from that position or fired. Suspicious register errors or discrepancies will be referred to RIT Public Safety for investigation.
- **Student Meal Receipts:** After cashing out a student employee using their student meal benefit you are responsible for ensuring that a receipt is printed, signed by the employee, and placed in the clear plastic box at that register. You are also responsible for initialing next to that employee’s name on the daily attendance sheet at your register to record that their meal benefit has been claimed.

<Subsection: The College Grind>

- **Grind Training:** All Grind employees must complete training for The College Grind before their first shift. You may not work in The College Grind, including as a sub shift, until you have completed Grind training.
- **Badge Number:** When working at The Grind, Commons employees should use their Grind punch-in number, not their Commons number.
